Note:
	- all tracks so far are based on uniquely aligned reads, unless otherwise stated, e.g. "_merged" or "M", former indicate uniquely aligned reads + multireads, and later indicate multireads only. 
	- Rowe et al, 2013 data are shown in this directory, including:
		- H3K9me3 ChIP - "H3K9me3_KAP1_KO_ChIP_dedup.bw", "H3K9me3_KAP1_KO_INPUT_dedup.bw","H3K9me3_WT_ChIP_dedup.bw", "H3K9me3_WT_INPUT_dedup.bw"
		- KAP1 ChIP - "KAP1_WT_ChIP_dedup.bw", "KAP1_KAP1KO_ChIP_dedup.bw", "KAP1_WT_Input_dedup.bw"
	- In BigBed folder, we have KAP1 peak coordinates kept in "KAP1_Rowe_2013_mm10.bb", we have CAST SNP coordinates kept in "CAST_SNPs_PASS.bb" in format <CHR> <START> <END> <ID; e.g. SNP2059, SNP2060, etc.> <a score; 0>
	- I am curious what Lorincz_DNMTTKO.bb contains, are they the 627 H3K9me3 lost regions in DNMT TKO ES cells?
